With every wrong guess one body part will be added to the hangman.
 
- So you need to guess all words without using all 6 lives to win the game.

- An array of words is already stored in game and from that array, the game randomly chooses a word. Then we are prompted
too guess the letter from that word, we are given 6 wrong chances if we guess the letters wrongly six times we lose the game.

- We win, when we guess the complete word in less than six wrong chances.
